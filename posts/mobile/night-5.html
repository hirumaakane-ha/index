                <ul>
                    <li><span class="dropcaps">After</span> the first public release of the site, I got overwhelmed by the positive responses and congratulations pouring in from my friend circle. But there was still this one big thought that loomed over my head for the next several days after the release.</li>
                    <li>Though the site had been successfully deployed on the internet with no hiccups or whatsoever, it was not optimized for mobile devices. It played out on a grand scale across the website, content would overlap each other creating a mess that was absolutely inedible at that point. Some of my friends, namely T2 (last guy was T1), D and K, suggested that I should explore the many possibilities of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap CSS library</a> to completely optimize my site for mobile viewing.</li>
                    <li>For those of you who have not heard of Bootstrap, it is basically a vastly huge library of standardized, formatted CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and HTML codes. So, how it works, you might ask yourself. At its core, CSS is separate file from your HTML files that, once called upon in the HTML files, will change the styles of the elements in your HTML pages, such as adding borders, margins, padding, or changing colors, fonts, boldness, etc. Further reading on CSS can be easily found on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/">W3School CSS tutorial page</a> and fundamentally learnt through various online courses.</li>
                    <li>Now, enough of the gibberish noob stuff that I am confidently bragging me knowledge about and start with the slightly more advanced stuff that is simple enough for a noob like me to understand and use. By using Bootstrap, you are exempted from manually format your page styles and all that limey, tedious codes. In its steads, you are armed with standardized dimensional and positional formats, such as the ones applied on containers so they won’t get all jumpy on your web browser and make your day worse.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>A side-by-side comparison between my messy old CSS file and the chic new CSS file</h4>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <img class="demo" alt="old css file HARamen &copy; 2018" src="https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/hirumaakane.cdn/hoanganhramen.img/night-5-demo-1.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <img class="demo" alt="new css file HARamen &copy; 2018;" src="https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/hirumaakane.cdn/hoanganhramen.img/night-5-demo-2.jpg">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>With Bootstrap, you can simply let your imagination wee itself free from all the troublesome rudimental formatting and create an actually professional and good-looking site. Now, please be noted that I am NOT saying that my site belongs to the pro and good-looking bunch, but let just say it looks better than however it was in the first days of conceptions. And nonetheless, the mobile consumption experience is turning for the better as well. With that done, Hoang Anh is back to being a good, jolly fella who starts to enjoy life again.</li>
                    <li>This new knowledge helps boost my confidence and enable me to scrap everything and rebuild the color palettes and layouts from the get-go. It was somewhat a pleasant experience for me to rebuild because now I can vividly visualize the layout in me head and immediately can relate such layouts with the elements that Bootstrap offers. (Note that I am using Bootstrap 4 at the composition of this post).</li>
                    <li>The whole rebuild process took a staggeringly small amount of time to complete and I rolled out the first page formatted with Bootstrap which is <a href=“night-4.html”>Night 4</a>. Then I use the themed page as a basis for rewriting my whole site.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Below, you can see the comparison between the old theme and the new theme</h4>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6">

            <p>Next, with an edible layout and twinkling colors that my site has put on, it is time to delve into the mobile nits and bits. But let’s just stop here for a wee bit and save it for the next post coming out on August 20th, 2018.</p>
