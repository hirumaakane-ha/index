                <ul>
                    <li>I had the day earlier (Friday) off so I sat in front of my desktop from dawn to dusk, alternating between playing online games, watching films and building my website üëå. I started off grinding some levels and some films that I hadn‚Äôt got a chance to see on Netflix and Crunchyroll/Kissanime/Primevideo/gogoanime (LMAO). Anyway, with the daylight started dimming at the horizon and shadows becoming more and more inseparable from its surroundings, I started the grind on my website hoanganhramen.xyz. Back then, my HTML/CSS attunement was not on par with whatever skills I am having now, so it took me ages to fine tune the individual attributes of each elements to match whatever I had in mind. And since I was subpar on my skills, I general prospect of the website was nothing but a bunch of patched elements.</li>
                    <li>In retrospect, I might have wasted the whole Friday night swapping color swatches and palettes üë©‚Äçüíª in order to make the website look somewhat edible. To help me with my cause, I enlisted two of my supportive people namely N and T.</li>
                    <li>It was now noon of Saturday and I would have dinner with some friends at 5PM so I was trying to squeeze in as many edits as I could. The technical problems I was facing were mainly involved with fixing the positioning and placement of my blog elements, not to mention the crappy taste in color palette. I at times messed up with the margin and padding attributes so it was one hell of a journey to properly put contents on the website.</li>
                    <li>Earlier that day, I read the responses on my website from N and T. One advised me to op for a white/light color palette. So I scrapped everything and redid the website‚Äôs face. But I was not satisfied with the changes, because I feel like there was too much blank space because of the white. However, it was time for the dinner so I left my test version there for them to rejudge.</li>
                    <li>It was a wholesome dinner considering how seldom I eat a home-cooked meal nowadays. We talked about many things that happened in our lives, dating tips, future prospects and what we are doing at the moment. Found out 2 people in the dinner group were in the same field that I would hopefully be in.</li>
                    <li>I returned with a bunch of take-home food. And after receiving positive-ish feedbacks from N and T, I went ahead and published my website for the first time, though I still felt the CSS-wised design fell short of my expectations.</li>
