                    <ul>
                        <li>Dear reader, I would dare to say that, somewhere in the back of your mind, you may have thought about how my marketing the website kind of disappeared from the feed for a period of time. At least until tonight. Well, the non-obvious reason is that I have been looking into other methods/frameworks/ways/etc.. of building a blog, the more obvious reason is that I’ve been drinking and hanging out quite a lot lately (which I rarely do, mind you).</li>
                        <li>Now that the clarification is out of the way, for this post, I will do a round-up of everything leading to my current progress on web development.</li>
                        <li>All started June 2018 when I got absolutely bored of the unrelated curriculums that I had been having (still do until F/2019) so I made up my tiny mind to do something I actually liked, which was programming, obviously.</li>
                        <li>I picked up Python where I left it several eons ago. Got into doing basic data visualization but stopped indefinitely. I had a motivation to build a consumable product so I steered my way into web building.</li>
                        <li>Behind the site that is now running perfectly smoothly on an Amazon EC2 server is a crapload of sleepless hours staying up into the morning and tinkering with the codes. In the last post, I talked about how I successfully revamped my website using Bootstrap 4 CSS library. I shall continue for a bit about how I optimize it for mobile viewing.</li>
                        <li>“At least the website is running perfectly and the links are all gucci” - I think to myself at the end of a coding session at Starbucks. The last month of summer means that I only have 30 days left to indulge myself in the bustling streets, the piping hot comfort food and the precious convenience. Once I move back into the dorm on the West Island, I will no longer have the luxury of sitting at a cafe in the evening with a cup of caramel macchiato at the table side and doing what I like best. Moving back shall mean total silence in the dead of night and the only convenience I will get is the poutine delivery coming from the town that is 10-minute-walk from the dorm. Yes. No more Vietnamese phở, Japanese ramen nor Chinese chow mein. I have to cook for myself, which is undesirable not because I’m terrible at it, but since I am such a sloth that I cannot bring myself to washing the dishes afterwards.</li>
                        <li>The atmosphere is just right for my doing my stuff. The dimly lit cafe along with the jazzy music playing in the background. Oh sorry, the dimly lit cafe with the J-Pop songs blasting away from my earphones, hitting my eardrums and registering the familiar audio signatures with my brain. Completely perfect. As people around were doing stuff on their laptops too. The screen light casts different shades of color onto their deep-in-thoughts faces. Who am I to judge, since I am doing the exact same thing, maybe not in the same field, but fundamentally the same: sitting at a cafe in the late evening, enjoying the atmosphere, sipping my cup of caffeine and let my mind relaxingly slip into whatever work I am doing.</li>
                        <li>I’m working on the mobile aspect of my website, in other words, making the site more edible on mobile devices. The main catch is the navigation bar which keeps running off all over the place when using on a phone screen, blocking content and such. Somewhere at the back of my mind pops up a quick and simple solution: anchor the navigation bar using the position property of a div in bootstrap. <i> See the images below for demonstration of the solution. </i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <img class="demo" alt="navbar old HARamen &copy; 2018" src="https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/hirumaakane.cdn/hoanganhramen.img/night-6-nav-1.png">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <img class="demo" alt="navbar new HARamen &copy; 2018;" src="https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/hirumaakane.cdn/hoanganhramen.img/night-6-nav-2.png">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>But doing that would take away the magic of a floaty nav bar for desktop. So, I decided to make a mobile version of each and every page on the site. The task is gruesomely tedious but what other choices I have? I end up creating a mobile folder on the site to store each and every mobile version of the site, except the index-mobile.html because I am not diligent enough to write the whole path every time I want to link the mobile version of the index page.</li>
                        <li>Next, I need to figure out how I can redirect the you guys to the right site version according to your varying screen sizes. I have to do some digging around stack exchange and w3schools to finally reach the solution: using JS to redirect the user in accordance to their screen size which can be grabbed by a function offered by JS. <i>Below, you can see the code snippet I use for the site.</i></li>
                        <li>Yeah, I might have made the post long by telling irrelevant stuff but here comes the important part: I just can’t keep doing the same for every page I create. Like I said, it is a not task for a sloth like myself. Drawing from that experience, my next endeavor would be creating a blog-aware site. That brings me to Jekyll, ReactJS, and Wordpress.</li>
                        <li>However, that is a long story for another day as this post has gotten quite heavy already.</li>
