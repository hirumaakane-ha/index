                    <h1>Setting up a web server</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It has been a long time since I last created a server on Amazon EC2. The reason made me give up on teaching myself how to develop a website from scratch was because I did not have enough time or a long enough period of time to invest in sitting in front of the computer screen due to having (a lot of) school work. Now it is summer, and I literally have all the time in the world, aside looking for jobs and interacting with fellow homo sapiens, to glue my posterior to the chair and start learning, setting up and developing my very own website.</li>
                        <li>12:30AM, after failing to write an RPG, I decided to do something else, something that does not necessary require formal training in the craft. Some neurons just sparked in my head that I wanted to create and host a web server. Then, I remembered that I actually had set some super-barebone servers during the Winter semester. So, fueled by my youthful exuberance and some Monster that I mistakenly bottom-up-ed that night without thinking about the consequences, I dived headfirst into creating a web server.</li>
                        <li>I went back to the first-things-first: creating a brand new EC2 instance hosted by Jeff to be my web server and deleting the incomplete remnants of my tinkering Winter. I used free tier (ofc, I’m not rich) and opted for the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS offered by Jeff. Now came a tad trickier part, which is creating and ssh-ing with a .PEM key from my local computer. It wasn’t hard to find a YouTube video showing exactly how to do it. For me, I followed the one by Inertia7.</li>
                        <li>Then, I just passed out on the bed due to extreme exhaustion and by the fact that I had to wake up earlier than usual (usual = 1 - 2PM) to have sushi (gosh I hate how people refer to a Japanese meal as 'go eat sushi') lunch with my extended family here.</li>
                    </ul>
